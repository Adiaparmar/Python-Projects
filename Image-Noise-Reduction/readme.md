# 📸 Image Noise Reduction and Evaluation

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to study the effects of various types of noise on digital images and implement techniques to reduce noise while maintaining the quality of the original image. The project also evaluates the performance of these noise reduction techniques using quantitative metrics like **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** and **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🌟 Noise Addition
The program simulates real-world image degradation by adding different types of noise to an image:
- **Gaussian Noise**: Models random variations in brightness.
- **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**: Randomly introduces white (salt) and black (pepper) pixels.
- **Speckle Noise**: Simulates noise proportional to pixel intensity.
- **Motion Blur**: Mimics the effect of movement during image capture.

### 2. 🛠️ Noise Reduction Filters
The program applies the following noise reduction techniques:
- **Averaging Filter**: Reduces noise by averaging pixel values in a local neighborhood.
- **Gaussian Filter**: Uses a Gaussian function for blurring, effective for Gaussian noise.
- **Median Filter**: Removes noise by replacing each pixel with the median value in its neighborhood, ideal for salt-and-pepper noise.
- **Bilateral Filter**: Smoothens images while preserving edges by combining spatial and intensity information.

### 3. 📊 Performance Evaluation
The effectiveness of noise reduction is assessed using:
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Measures the difference between the original and filtered images.
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: Evaluates perceptual quality by comparing structures in the images.

### 4. 🖼️ Visualization
The results are displayed in a grid format, showing:
- The original image.
- The noisy image.
- Filtered images alongside their PSNR and SSIM values.

### 5. 💾 Image Saving
All noisy and filtered images are saved to a specified output folder for later analysis.
